// Package gosort implements a set of common sorting algorithms.
//
// The code in this library was written as a learning exercise. Please note the
// following limitations: it only supports sorting of arrays of ordered types,
// i.e. numbers and strings; no attempt has been made to optimise the performance
// of the implementations beyond the natural efficiency of the algorithms themselves.
