# Generics Workshop Using a Library of Sorting Algorithms in Go

This project contains the Go source code for some common sorting algorithms and
a simple command line front-end to try them out.

However, the implementations only support slices of integers as inputs.

Follow the steps in [generics_workshop_test.go](./generics_workshop_test.go)
to apply generics to all the sorting algorithms so they can sort strings and
integers and ultimately all slices containing ordinal elements.
