Sorting Algorithms in Go
========================

The project contains the [Go][1] source code for some sorting algorithms
intended to accompany a series of blog posts I want to write about algorithms.

For more information see:

* [The Go programming language][1]
* [Algorithms in Go Blog Series][2]

Limitations
-----------

The code in this library is **designed for learning**, so any potential users
should note the following limitations:

* It only supports sorting of integer arrays, this is purely to keep the code
  simple and readable by avoiding having to deal with generic issues.
* No attempt has been made to optimise the performance of the implementations.
