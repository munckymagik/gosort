# Sorting Algorithms in Go

This project contains the [Go][1] source code for some common sorting algorithms and
a simple command line front-end to try them out.

## Limitations

The code in this library was written as a learning exercise. Please note the following limitations:

* It only supports sorting of arrays of ordered types. I.e. numbers and strings.
* No attempt has been made to optimise the performance of the implementations beyond the natural
  efficiency of the algorithms themselves.
