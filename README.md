Sorting Algorithms in Go
========================

This project contains the [Go][1] source code for some common sorting algorithms and
a simple command line front-end to try them out.

For more information about Go see:

* [The Go programming language][1]

Limitations
-----------

The code in this library is designed as a **reference** and for **learning**, so any potential users
should note the following limitations:

* It only supports sorting of integer arrays. This is intended to maximise
  simplicity and readability by avoiding having to deal with generic type issues.
* No attempt has been made to optimise the performance of the implementations beyond the natural
  efficiency of the algorithms themselves.
