[x] How do I structure a Go package?

The port of Mustache to [Go][gomustache] puts the root of the package in
the root project directory so that the project may be imported like so:

    import "github.com/hoisie/mustache"

This is smelly.  What if I no longer wish to host on github?  The entire
source code of a project that uses this would need a search and replace
and a recompile to fix this.

[ ] How do I create a test?

Import the testing package and create a function with the signature:

    func TestXxx(*testing.T)

[ ] How do I run a test?
[ ] How can I reuse the same test for all the various sorting algorithms?
